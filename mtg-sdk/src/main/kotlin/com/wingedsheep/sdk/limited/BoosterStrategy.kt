/**
 * Play Booster (Murders at Karlov Manor, February 2024, onward): the 14-card pack
 * that replaced both Draft and Set Boosters. Paper composition:
 *
 *  - Slots 1–7: 7 commons (slot 7 carries a 1.5% Special Guest chance — not modeled)
 *  - Slots 8–10: 3 uncommons
 *  - Slot 11: non-foil wildcard of any rarity
 *  - Slot 12: rare or mythic rare (12.5% mythic)
 *  - Slot 13: basic land
 *  - Slot 14: traditional-foil wildcard of any rarity
 *
 * Engine adaptation: foils, The List, and Special Guests are not modeled, so both
 * wildcard slots are plain weighted-rarity slots; the basic-land slot is omitted
 * because the generator strips basic lands from the pool and supplies them
 * separately at deck building. Net result: 13 playable non-land cards per pack.
 *
 * Wildcard rarity weights approximate WotC's published pack-level odds (~37% of
 * packs carry a second rare/mythic and ~4% a third → ~20% rare-or-mythic per
 * wildcard, split 7:1 rare:mythic).
 *
 * No card name is duplicated within a single pack.

/**
 * Commander Legends 2020 -shaped booster: 20 cards split into 13 commons, 3 uncommons,
 * 2 dedicated legendary slots, 1 non-legendary rare-or-mythic, and 1 bonus card of any rarity.
 *
 * The legendary slots hold a legendary creature or legendary planeswalker of any rarity. They
 * do not consume the non-legendary rare-or-mythic slot — both ship together, so a pack always
 * carries a non-leg R/M *and* two legendaries.
 *
 * The bonus slot replaces Commander Legends' traditional foil slot (the engine does not model
 * foils). Distribution is weighted to roughly mirror the foil-slot rarity mix: mostly common,
 * sometimes uncommon, occasionally rare or mythic.
 *
 * Sparse-legendary fallback: if the pool has fewer legendaries than required slots (or none at
 * all), the missing slots are filled with [piperFallback] when supplied, and otherwise demoted to
 * additional non-legendary uncommons. Callers that want to flag a Piper-substituted pool for
 * downstream commander selection should compare the resulting pack against the input pool.
 *
 * @param piperFallback A colourless legendary creature card (typically The Prismatic Piper) used
 *                      to back-fill legendary slots when the set has no legendaries. The fallback
 *                      is never drawn from the booster pool itself — supply it explicitly.
