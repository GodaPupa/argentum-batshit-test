/**
 * Shared door-lock primitive (CR 709.5g) — the twin of [RoomDoorUnlocker]. Removes the "unlocked"
 * designation from a single unlocked face of a Room permanent and emits the resulting event.
 *
 * This is the one place that re-locks a [RoomComponent] door. Unlike unlocking, locking is not a
 * trigger source and can never fully unlock a Room, so it emits only a [DoorLockedEvent] — there is
 * no companion "fully unlocked" event and nothing for "When you unlock this door" triggers to fire
 * on. The locked half's name/cost/text turn off through normal projection of [RoomComponent.unlocked].

     * half's continuous statics.
