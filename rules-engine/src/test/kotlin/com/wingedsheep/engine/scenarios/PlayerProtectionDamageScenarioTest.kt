/**
 * Player-level protection — the **D**amage half of DEBT (CR 702.16e): a player carrying a
 * PlayerProtectionComponent (The One Ring's "protection from everything until your next turn")
 * has damage from a matching source prevented, not just targeting blocked.
 *
 * The targeting half is exercised elsewhere (a protected player can't be the target of a spell);
 * this guards the damage-prevention branch in DamageUtils against a *non-targeted* source, where
 * the targeting block never runs. "Deal 3 damage to each player" hits both players from one
 * source: the protected player takes none (prevented — protection from everything covers any
 * source, including its controller's own per CR 702.16e), while the unprotected opponent takes
 * the full 3, proving the source really deals damage and only the protected player is spared.
 *
 * Inline cards, no set dependency.
